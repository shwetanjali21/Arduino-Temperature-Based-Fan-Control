ðŸŒ¡ Arduino Temperature-Based Fan Control

This project demonstrates how to control a fan (simulated with an LED) using an Arduino Uno and a temperature sensor.

Below 25Â°C â†’ Fan OFF

25Â°C to 30Â°C â†’ Fan runs at 50% speed (PWM)

Above 30Â°C â†’ Fan runs at 100% speed


The live temperature and fan state are printed to the Serial Monitor.


ðŸ›  Components (Virtual in Wokwi)

Arduino Uno

Temperature input: LM35 (or Potentiometer to simulate NTC)

LED + 220Î© resistor (Fan simulation on pin D9)

Serial Monitor (built-in)


ðŸ“‚ How to Use

1. Open this code in Wokwi Arduino Simulator.


2. Connect components as described:

LM35 OUT â†’ A0, VCC â†’ 5V, GND â†’ GND

LED + resistor â†’ Pin D9 â†’ GND



3. Paste the code into sketch.ino.


4. Run the simulation â†’ open Serial Monitor to see live updates.


5. Change the temperature sensor value to test different fan states.


ðŸ“· Demo

<25Â°C: LED OFF (Fan OFF)

25â€“30Â°C: LED dim (Fan 50%)

>30Â°C: LED bright (Fan 100%)
